# binary_classification_breast_cancer
During their life, among 8% of women are diagnosed with Breast cancer (BC), after lung cancer, BC is the second popular cause of death
in both developed and undeveloped worlds. BC is characterized by the mutation of genes, constant pain, changes in the size, color(redness),skin texture of breasts. 
Classification of breast cancer leads pathologists to find a systematic and objective prognostic, generally the most frequent classification is binary (benign cancer/malign cancer). Today, Machine Learning
(ML) techniques are being broadly used in the breast cancer classification problem. They provide high classification accuracy and effective diagnostic capabilities. In this report, we present
three different classifiers: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis for breast cancer classification. 
We propose a comparison between the three implementations and evaluate their accuracy using cross validation. 
Results show that Quadratic Discriminant Analysis gives the highest accuracy(93.9%) followed by Logistic Regression(93%) and Linear Regression(92.5%)
